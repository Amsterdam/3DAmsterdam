# 3DAmsterdam

3D Amsterdam is a platform ( available at 3d.amsterdam.nl ) where the city of Amsterdam can be experienced interactively, and where communication and participation is made more accessible.
  More and more information and data is embedded in 3D, allowing future features like running simulations, and   
providing insight in decision making processes.

## Unity 2019.4. (LTS)
The project is using the latest LTS (long-term support) release of Unity: 2019.4. 
  We will stick to this version untill new engine feature updates are required for the sake of maximum stability.
## WebGL/Universal Render Pipeline
Currently the main target platform is a WebGL(2.0) application.
  The project is set up to use the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline), focussing on high performance for lower end machines. Please note that shaders/materials have specific requirements in order to work in this render pipeline.
