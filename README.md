## ⚠️ Development Has Moved!

**Attention:** Development for this project has moved to a new location.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.

# 3DAmsterdam

3D Amsterdam is a platform ( available at 3d.amsterdam.nl ) where the city of Amsterdam can be experienced interactively in 3D.

The main goals are:
- providing information about the city;
- making communication and participation more accessible through visuals;
- viewing and sharing 3D models.

More and more information and data is embedded, allowing future features like running simulations, visualization of solar and wind studies and showing impact of spatial urban changes. It will improve public insight in decision making processes.

## Unity 2021.3 (LTS)
The project is using the latest LTS (long-term support) release of Unity: 2021.3.*<br/>
We will upgrade the minor updates for the same LTS often due to stability improvements of the WebGL platform.
## WebGL/Universal Render Pipeline
Currently the main target platform is a WebGL(2.0) application.<br/>
The project is set up to use the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline), focussing on high performance for lower end machines. Please note that shaders/materials have specific requirements in order to work in this render pipeline.
## Code convention 
All the project code and comments should be written in English. Content text is written in Dutch.<br/>

## Unity Input System

The project uses the new Unity input system called Input Action Assets. The input mappings are defined in 
`\Assets\Netherlands3D\Input\3DNetherlands.inputactions`

This will then generate a c# class that will be used in 
`\Assets\Netherlands3D\Input\ActionHandler.cs`

## Tile System

The platform uses a tile based system consisting of 1km by 1km tiles. The handling of the tiles is initiated by the TileHandler which resides under the /Layers in the scene and needs to be configured with the active Layers that implement the Layer baseclass. 

We currently have 4 implemented Layers which are 

- Buildings
- Trees
- Sewerage
- Terrain

Each Layer script needs implement the HandleLayer method. This function receives a TileChange variable that provides the [RD](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksdriehoeksco%C3%B6rdinaten)  X and Y coordinate and an action.

The available actions are

- Create (create the tile)
- Upgrade (the Level of detail increases)
- Downgrade (the Level of detail decreases)
- Remove (remove the tile)

## Generating Tile System tiles

The 3D tiles used by the Tile System can be generated by the TileBakeTool.
You can find this tool in its own repository: 
https://github.com/Amsterdam/CityDataToBinaryModel

## Contributing

If you like to contribute to 3DAmsterdam we encourage you to do so via the open source Netherlands3D repository; a modular Unity package containing functionalities independant of 3DAmsterdam that are useful for other municipalities:
