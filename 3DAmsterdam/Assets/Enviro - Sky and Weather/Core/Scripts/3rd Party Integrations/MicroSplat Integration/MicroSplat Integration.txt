If you are using Microsplat (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/96478) as you terrain shader and using some of the advanced modules like Dynamic Snow or Wetness/Streams/Puddles you can synchronze these with enviro weather system.

1. Add the Enviro MicroSplat component to one of your gameobjects in scene.
2. Enable modules in MicroSplat material editor.
3. Enable the "Global Driven Property" in each module of Microsplat by clicking on the "G" next to the setting. For example at Snow Modules -> Amount.
4. That's all! :)
