If you own a copy of "UBER Shaders" (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/39959) you can use the script in the RAR archive to synchronize enviro weather with your UBER materials!
Just unpack and add the component to a random gameobject in your scene and assign the Global_Parameter component from UBER.
